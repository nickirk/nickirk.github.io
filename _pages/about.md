I have a strong interest in the theoretical and algorithmic development for solving
strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, 
as well as in the application of these methods to study the electronic
structure of molecules and materials. I am specilised in traditional electronic structure theories, 
including coupled cluster, DMRG, transcorrelation theory, etc; I am also exploring new 
interdisciplinary areas such as machine learning, quantum chemistry and materials science.
I have a Ph.D. in quantum chemistry from the 
Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research in Stuttgart, Germany, under the joint supervision of
Prof. Ali Alavi and Prof. Andreas Gr√ºneis.
I worked as a part-time external science consultant for ByteDance in their pursuit of solving quantum chemical problems using
machine learning.
Furthermore, I did a postdoc at California Institute of Technology with Prof. Garnet Chan.
During my past experience, I have contributed to 
VASP, PySCF, as well as coded my own package PyMES. 
Currently, I am a postdoctoral research associate at Yale University with Prof. Tianyu Zhu.
