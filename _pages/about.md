I have a strong interest in the theoretical and algorithmic development for solving
strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, 
as well as in the application of these methods to study the electronic
structure of molecules and materials. 
I have a Ph.D. in quantum chemistry from the 
Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research in Stuttgart, Germany, under the joint supervision of
Prof. Ali Alavi and Prof. Andreas Gr√ºneis.
I worked as a part-time external science consultant for ByteDance in their pursuit of solving quantum chemical problems using
machine learning.
Furthermore, I did a postdoc at California Institute of Technology with Prof. Garnet Chan.
During my past experience, I have contributed to well-known softwares, such as
VASP, PySCF, as well as coded my own package PyMES. I constantly learn from
colleagues or teach myself new theories and methods that significantly go beyond my
past education.
