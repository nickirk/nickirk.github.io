  abstract = {The simultaneous treatment of static and dynamical correlations in strongly-correlated electron systems is a critical challenge. In particular, finding a universal scheme for identifying a single-particle orbital basis that minimizes the representational complexity of the many-body wavefunction is a formidable and longstanding problem. As a substantial contribution towards its solution, we show that the total orbital correlation actually reveals and quantifies the intrinsic complexity of the wavefunction,once it is minimized via orbital rotations. To demonstrate the power of this concept in practice, an iterative scheme is proposed to optimize the orbitals by minimizing the total orbital correlation calculated by the tailored coupled cluster singles and doubles (TCCSD) ansatz. The optimized orbitals enable the limited TCCSD ansatz to capture more non-trivial information of the many-body wavefunction, indicated by the improved wavefunction and energy. An initial application of this scheme shows great improvement of TCCSD in predicting the singlet ground state potential energy curves of the strongly correlated C\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 2\}\$ and Cr\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 2\}\$ molecule.},

  abstract = {We present the theory of a density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm which can solve for both the ground and excited states of non-Hermitian transcorrelated Hamiltonians and show applications in molecular systems. Transcorrelation (TC) accelerates the basis set convergence rate by including known physics (such as, but not limited to, the electron--electron cusp) in the Jastrow factor used for the similarity transformation. It also improves the accuracy of approximate methods such as coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) as shown by recent studies. However, the non-Hermiticity of the TC Hamiltonians poses challenges for variational methods like DMRG. Imaginary-time evolution on the matrix product state (MPS) in the DMRG framework has been proposed to circumvent this problem, but this is currently limited to treating the ground state and has lower efficiency than the time-independent DMRG (TI-DMRG) due to the need to eliminate Trotter errors. In this work, we show that with minimal changes to the existing TI-DMRG algorithm, namely, replacing the original Davidson solver with the general Davidson solver to solve the non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonians at each site for a few low-lying right eigenstates, and following the rest of the original DMRG recipe, one can find the ground and excited states with improved efficiency compared to the original DMRG when extrapolating to the infinite bond dimension limit in the same basis set. An accelerated basis set convergence rate is also observed, as expected, within the TC framework.},

  abstract = {We propose a streamlined combination of the transcorrelation (TC) and coupled cluster (CC) theory, which not only increases the convergence rate with respect to the basis set but also extends the applicability of the lowest-order CC approximations to strongly correlated systems. Using the three-dimensional uniform electron gas as a model for real periodic solids and highly accurate ground-state energies from the state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo methods as benchmark, we show that, with the correct physical insights incorporated, our TC-CC methods gain drastic improvements in accuracy compared with canonical CC methods, and the errors of our methods remain {\textpm}0.001 Hartree per electron (Ha/electron) across a wide range of densities. With the greatly improved efficiencies and the balanced and accurate performances at both low and high densities, our methods present great promise for applications on real solids with weak and strong correlations.},

The outlined technique shares similarities with electronic structure factor interpolation methods used in quantum Monte Carlo calculations. However, our approach does not require the calculation of density matrices. Furthermore we show that the proposed finite size corrections achieve chemical accuracy in the convergence of second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation and coupled cluster singles and doubles correlation energies per atom for insulating solids with two atomic unit cells using 2 {\texttimes} 2 {\texttimes} 2 and 3 {\texttimes} 3 {\texttimes} 3 k-point meshes only.}
